// ── THIS IS THE CALLER `pool.go` WAS WRITTEN WITHOUT ────────────────────────
//
// `internal/routers` has held both halves for some time — `SyncPool` and the
// per-session lifecycle as pure state in `overview.go`, the sockets and the
// three collectors in `pool.go` — and was constructed by nobody, because whether
// a Go pool may run DURING COEXISTENCE was an operator decision: Node runs the
// same pool against the same fleet, so both holding a connection to every router
// at once is a real cost. The strangler rule was lifted; this is the caller.
//
// ── THE EXCLUSION IS THE WHOLE CORRECTNESS ARGUMENT ─────────────────────────
//
// A router somebody has OPEN must not also get a background session. Two
// connections to one router is the visible cost; recording every up/down
// transition twice is the one that corrupts history. So `excluded` is derived
// from the session manager on every sync rather than tracked separately — a
// second source of truth about who is watching what is exactly the thing that
// drifts.

// decodeGeo turns the record's raw `geo` block into the map ResolveLocation
// validates, and answers nil for anything it cannot read.
//
// LENIENT ON PURPOSE, matching why the field is stored raw: the block is
// operator-editable, and `geoplace.ResolveLocation` already checks every value
// it uses. A router with a malformed `geo` loses its pin; it must not take the
// rest of the fleet's rows down with it, which a hard failure here would do.

// ── WHAT CHANGED ON 2026-08-28 ──────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// This was a single function returning a typed `publicRouter` of ELEVEN fields.
// The live payload carries twenty-three. Live verification — the Go server and
// Node asked for `/api/routers` with the same cookie against the same /data —
// showed twelve keys missing:
//
//	addedAt  alertsEnabled  backup  connDownThresholdSec  geo  model
//	osVersion  password  pingTarget  serial  siteId  tlsInsecure
//
// The Routers page shows `model` and `osVersion`; the Add/Edit modal reads
// `pingTarget`, `tlsInsecure`, `backup` and `geo`, so it seeded defaults and a
// save would have written them over the operator's values.
//
// The old header argued the absence was STRONGER than the live masking — "a mask
// that is forgotten leaks, an absent field cannot". True of the password and
// false of the other eleven, which are not secrets and are not optional.
// `store.PublicRouters` now does what `getPublic()` does: keep everything, mask
// the password, fold `backup.password` into `hasPassword`.
//
// ── AND RULE 3 IS NO LONGER VACUOUS ─────────────────────────────────────────
//
// It used to read: "THE WAN ADDRESS IS STRIPPED from `geo.auto.ip` for anyone
// without `system:settings`… RULE 3 IS VACUOUS IN THIS PORT TODAY", because
// `store.Router` had no `Geo` field and no WAN address reached the payload.
// It does now. The note predicted its own expiry — "the day `Geo` is added to
// that struct is the day the disclosure reopens" — and this is that day.
//
// ── ONE SHAPE, SINCE 2026-08-29 ─────────────────────────────────────────────
//
//	routerListForSocket  filtered + STRIPPED   `routers:update` AND `GET /api/routers`
//
// There used to be a second, unstripped shape here for the HTTP route, because
// the live HTTP route did not strip while `/api/localcc`, the socket payload and
// the stats payload all did. That divergence was REPRODUCED rather than quietly
// fixed — a port that withholds a field the live app sends is a user-visible
// change — and filed in `../MikroDash/ToDo.md` on 2026-08-28. This note said
// "when upstream fixes it, delete `routerListFor` and let both callers use the
// socket shape", and upstream fixed it in `a4ac96e` on 2026-08-29, with
// `_stripWanIp` lifted to module scope and called from both paths. So that is
// what this now is.
//
// The upstream commit message is worth keeping, because it is this port's own
// finding coming back: "Found by the Go/TypeScript port's endpoint-by-endpoint
// payload diff — not by any test, because a round trip through one
// implementation agrees with itself whatever it disclosed."

// debounce, populated by both fleet syncs. Their only reader was
// `alertPoolStatus`, the hook `internal/alertpool` called on a connect or a
// drop: that hook was handed a router id and a bool and nothing else, and
// reading the record there would have meant `store.Routers()` — which decrypts
// every router's password with scrypt — on every connect and drop.
//
// The pool is gone and every router nobody is watching is held as a SESSION, so
// the session writes `connectivity_events` and carries the threshold off its own
// record: `connThreshMs`, built once in `Acquire`. There is no hook left with
// nothing but an id, so there is nothing left to cache for. Removed rather than
// left populated and unread — see `internal/server/connthresh_test.go`, which
// is where the property this protected is asserted now.

// devicesFocus is what a browser opening the Devices page sets in motion.
//
// The pool RESUMES on the first watcher and suspends on the last, matching
// `_routersPageSockets`: nobody looking at the page means nothing needs the
// background rows, and holding a connection to every router for a page no one
// has open is the cost this design exists to avoid.

	// the socket that is already open, which is why this is here and not in the
	// two-second tick — by the second frame the overview pool is answering, and
	// re-reading would be a command channel spent on a question already asked.
	//
	// AFTER THE SYNCS, and the order is load-bearing rather than incidental —
	// it was questioned in review precisely because nothing here said why.
	//

	// session whose flags changed and drops one the overview pool has taken
	// over, and a rebuilt session is a new socket with no reading on it. Priming
	// ahead of that spends a command on sessions that are then discarded, and
	// the frame goes out with the gap still in it. Priming after means every
	// reading taken belongs to a session that is still there when
	// `Snapshots()` is read a few lines below.
	//
	// The cost of this order is the one `fillFromAlertPool` handles: `syncPool`
	// has started the overview dials by now and they return in 130 ms to 2 s, so
	// a summary can be `Known` with a nil `System` when the frame is built. That

// (internal/routers/assemble.go: a NIL `Visible` means unrestricted, an EMPTY

// and no router-scoped grant sees precisely what somebody with no routers
// configured sees — "No routers configured." — and nothing anywhere says which
// of the two it is.
//
// That is how issue #129 arrived: a blank Devices page, no logs, and no way to
// tell an authorization result from an empty fleet without reading the source.
// The fix for the bug is whatever the grants turn out to be; the fix for the
// DIAGNOSIS is this line.
//

// ACCESS SCOPE rather than because no routers are configured.
