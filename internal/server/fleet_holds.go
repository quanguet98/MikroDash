// Holding a session for every router that needs one — the port of
// `_syncAlertSessions`, and what is left of it after phase 4.3.
//
// ── THIS FILE USED TO WIRE A SECOND POOL ───────────────────────────────────
//
// The live app runs TWO background pools. `internal/routers.Pool` is
// `overviewSessions`, gated on the Devices page. `alertSessions` was the other,
// ALWAYS ON: one session per non-disabled router, whatever anyone is looking at.
// This port had `internal/alertpool` for it. Its absence had cost two things,
// and they are worth keeping written down because they are what any replacement
// must still deliver:
//
//	alerts    `alertwire.Evaluate` is reached from ONE place — the emit closure
//	          in session.go — so with `-alert-dispatch` on, alerts fired only for
//	          the router on screen. An operator would believe the fleet covered.
//	status    non-active routers read Offline until the Devices page was opened,
//	          which is how the operator noticed on 2026-08-29.
//
// ── AND NOW A `session.Session` DELIVERS BOTH ──────────────────────────────
//
// A Session already feeds the alert evaluator and the history recorder at that
// one seam. The only reason a second pool existed is that a Session died when
// its last viewer left. Phase 4.3 gave the manager NAMED HOLDS, so a router that
// needs alerting, recording, or merely a socket is held instead — and the pool
// became a duplicate implementation of a thing this app already had.
//
// `session.Needs` is what keeps that from being a regression: a held session
// runs only what its holders read, and a WARM one runs no collectors at all.
// Measured 2026-09-08, one unwatched router: the pool cost 119-120 commands a
// minute and a held session costs ~127, against the 264-287 an unpruned session
// would.
//
// ── IT SHARES `-no-pool` WITH THE OVERVIEW POOL, DELIBERATELY ──────────────
//
// Live gates the two separately, because one is bound to a page and the other is
// not. Here they share a switch because the switch means one thing — "do not
// hold background connections to routers nobody is watching" — and somebody
// passing it wants exactly that from both. Documented rather than assumed; if
// finer control is ever needed, splitting the flag is a small change and this
// comment is where to start.

// warmExclusions is the set of routers that need no WARM hold, because
// something else is already answering for them.
//
// A method rather than a local, so the handover rule below can be asserted
// without driving a whole sync against a fleet.
//
// ── ONLY WARM IS EXCLUDED, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE DISTINCTION ───────────────
//
// `alerts` and `history` are holds for WORK: collectors this app must run
// wherever the router is otherwise held, because the overview pool does not run
// them. `warm` is a hold for a FACT — is this router up — and any source that
// can state the fact makes it redundant.
func (s *Server) warmExclusions() map[string]bool {
	excluded := map[string]bool{}

	// ── THE OVERVIEW POOL'S ROUTERS — ONCE IT HAS ANSWERED FOR THEM ─────────
	//
	// Excluded when the overview session has ANSWERED, not merely when it
	// exists. `syncPool` builds a session per router and `syncFleetHolds` runs
	// immediately after it, so excluding on existence dropped a live, connected
	// hold and handed the router to a pool that had not dialled yet. The Devices
	// page then lost the only source that could answer for those routers, so
	// they showed as not-yet-known for the ~2s the overview pool took to connect
	// — measured on this install, cold open, 130ms to 2150ms. Before `Known`
	// existed they showed as OFFLINE, in red, which is the defect the operator
	// reported twice.
	//
	// The overlap this costs is bounded and short. `Known` goes true on the
	// first connect AND on the first error, so a router that is genuinely down
	// is excluded as soon as the overview pool finds that out, rather than being
	// held by both for ever.
	//
	// THE INTERACTIVE-SESSION CLAUSE IS GONE, and its absence is not an
	// oversight. It excluded routers with a live `Session` because a second pool
	// would have opened a second socket to them. A hold is taken on THAT SAME
	// session — `Retain` adds a reason to it, it does not build anything — so
	// there is nothing left to exclude it from.

}

// syncFleetHolds is `_syncAlertSessions()`: hold a session for every
// non-disabled router that needs one, and let go of the ones that do not.
//
// Called from the same places as `syncPool`, because the two answer the same
// question — "who is watching what" — and a change that affects one affects the
// other. The exclusion set is derived on every call rather than tracked, for the
// reason `syncPool` gives: a second record of who is watching what drifts from
// the first.

	//    DIVERGENCE ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

	// `_syncAlertSessions` passes `activeRouterId` and skips it, because the live
	// app ALWAYS holds a session for the active router — `_routerSessions` has
	// one whether or not a browser is open, so skipping it costs nothing.
	//
	// THIS PORT HAS NO SUCH SESSION. `session.Manager.Acquire` is ref-counted:
	// the session exists while somebody is looking and is torn down when the last
	// viewer leaves. Skipping the active router by id therefore leaves it covered
	// by NOTHING the moment the last browser closes — no status, no alert
	// evaluation, on the one router the install is pointed at.
	//
	// Measured 2026-08-29: with no browser open, `/healthz` reported the active
	// router down because neither the session nor the pool held it.

	// THE SAME RESOLUTION THE POOL AND THE PAGE USE. Taken raw, a router with
	// no default interface recorded an empty traffic stream — and these are the
	// sessions that run when nobody is watching, so their history simply did not
	// exist. See `syncPool`.

		// cards while the overview pool dials.
		//
		// A warm hold runs NO collectors — see `session.Reasons.Warm` — which is
